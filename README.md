# Introduction:
The Airbnb dataset is a popular dataset used for data analysis and visualization projects. In this project, we analyze the Airbnb dataset to gain insights into the rental market in different cities around the world. This project is based on data from Inside Airbnb, a website that collects data on Airbnb listings in cities around the world.

## Project Overview:
This project uses Tableau for data visualization and analysis. The project consists of the following components:

### Data Cleaning:
The data is cleaned and pre-processed before visualizing the data. Any missing values or outliers are removed to get an accurate analysis.

### Data Visualization:
The cleaned data is then visualized using Tableau. Various visualizations like maps, bar charts, and scatter plots are used to analyze the data.

### Dashboard Creation: 
The visualizations are then combined into a dashboard. The dashboard provides an overview of the data and allows users to interact with the data by filtering, selecting, and sorting the data.

### Data Source:
The dataset used in this project is obtained from Inside Airbnb. It consists of the following files:

• listings.csv.gz - This file contains information about the Airbnb listings, including the listing id, the host id, the property type, and the price.

• reviews.csv.gz - This file contains information about the reviews of the listings, including the review id, the listing id, the date of the review, and the reviewer id.

• calendar.csv.gz - This file contains information about the availability of the listings, including the listing id, the date of availability, and the price.

### Visualizations:
The following visualizations are included in this project:

* Map of Airbnb Listings: A map of the listings in different cities is created. The map provides information about the density of the listings in each city.

* Price Distribution: A histogram of the price distribution of the listings is created. The histogram shows the range of prices of the listings.

* Room Type Analysis: A bar chart is created to analyze the room types of the listings. The chart shows the number of listings based on the room type.

* Availability Analysis: A scatter plot is created to analyze the availability of the listings. The plot shows the availability of the listings over time.

* Review Analysis: A word cloud is created to analyze the reviews of the listings. The word cloud shows the most commonly used words in the reviews.

### Dashboard:
The dashboard includes the above visualizations and allows users to interact with the data. The filters in the dashboard allow users to filter the data based on city, room type, and price range.

### Conclusion:
This project provides insights into the Airbnb rental market. The visualizations provide information about the distribution of the listings, the room types, the availability, and the reviews of the listings. The dashboard allows users to interact with the data and gain insights into the rental market in different cities.
